# Runner
UE4 game with gameplay similar to temple run

Created dynamic map generation using a set of predefined paths along with random coin generation.
Used triggers at the end of each path segment to create a new one when player actor world move over it and delete the older path.
Also added sound effects for coin collection, imported death animations and a small HUD for coin count. 

Created with both C++ classes and blueprints for creating a well combined performing game.
